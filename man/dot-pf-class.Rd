\value{
This object is a named list, with two elements, which records the parameters used in the call to \code{\link[flapper]{pf}} and the particles sampled at each time step:

\describe{
  \item{args}{A named list that records the function arguments used to generate outputs. This is as inputted, but with the `calc_distance_graph' elements added if unsupplied and applicable.}
  \item{history}{A list of dataframes, one for each time step, that record particle samples. Each dataframe comprises \code{n} rows (one for each particle) and the following five columns:}
  \itemize{
    \item{id_previous}{ An integer that uniquely defines a previous location on the \code{record} \code{\link[raster]{raster}}s. This is absent for the first time step. For subsequent time steps, this is \code{NA} if the fast Euclidean distances method has been used, which does not `remember' previous locations, but specified otherwise.)}
    \item{pr_current}{ A double that defines the movement probabilities associated with previous locations. This is absent for the first time step. For subsequent time steps, this is \code{NA} if the fast Euclidean distances method has been used, which does not `remember' previous locations, but specified otherwise.}
    \item{id_current}{ An integer that uniquely defines each location on the \code{record} \code{\link[raster]{raster}}s.}
    \item{pr_current} A double that defines the probability of movement into each cell.
    \item{timestep}{ An integer that defines each time step.}

\description{
An S3 class that defines the object returned by \code{\link[flapper]{pf}}.

\seealso{
\code{\link[flapper]{dat_dcpf_histories}} provides an example of a \code{\link[flapper]{.pf-class}} object. \code{\link[flapper]{pf_simplify}} converts \code{\link[flapper]{.pf-class}} objects into \code{\link[flapper]{pf-class}} objects that comprise the reconstructed movement paths.
