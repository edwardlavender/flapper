    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <dl><dt>acoustics</dt>
<dd><p>A dataframe, or a list of dataframes, that contains passive acoustic telemetry detection time series (see <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>).</p></dd>


<dt>archival</dt>
<dd><p>A dataframe that contains depth time series (see <code><a href="dat_archival.html">dat_archival</a></code> for an example) for a specific individual. This should contain the following columns: a numeric vector of observed depths, named `depth'; and a POSIXct vector of time stamps when observations were made, named `timestamp'. Depths should be recorded in the same units and with the same sign as the bathymetry data (see <code>bathy</code>). Absolute depths (m) are suggested. Unlike the detection time series, archival time stamps are assumed to have occurred at regular intervals. Both acoustic and archival time series are rounded to the resolution of <code>archival</code> observations to ensure alignment (see Details). `Duplicate' observations (of the same individual at the same receiver, if applicable, in the same time step) are dropped.</p></dd>


<dt>plot_ts</dt>
<dd><p>A logical input that defines whether or not to plot the detection and depth time series before the algorithm is initiated. This provides a useful visualisation of the extent to which they overlap.</p></dd>


<dt>bathy</dt>
<dd><p>A <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/raster/man/raster.html" class="external-link">raster</a></code> that defines the bathymetry across the area within which the individual could have moved. This must be recorded in the same units and with the same sign as the depth observations (see <code>archival</code>). The coordinate reference system should be the Universal Transverse Mercator system, with distances in metres (see also <code><a href="acs_setup_containers.html">acs_setup_containers</a></code>).</p></dd>


<dt>detection_containers</dt>
<dd><p>A list of detection containers, with one element for each number from <code>1:max(acoustics$receiver_id)</code>, from <code><a href="acs_setup_containers.html">acs_setup_containers</a></code>.</p></dd>


<dt>detection_kernels</dt>
<dd><p>A named list of detection probability kernels (see <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>).</p></dd>


<dt>detection_kernels_overlap</dt>
<dd><p>(optional) A named list of detection probability kernel overlaps (see <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>).</p></dd>


<dt>detection_time_window</dt>
<dd><p>A number that defines the detection time window (see <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>).</p></dd>


<dt>mobility</dt>
<dd><p>The mobility parameter (see <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>).</p></dd>


<dt>calc_depth_error</dt>
<dd><p>A function that returns the depth errors around a vector of depths. The function should accept vector of depths (from <code>archival$depth</code>) and return a matrix, with one row for each (lower and upper) error and one one column for each depth (if the error varies with depth). For each depth, the two numbers are added to the observed depth to define the range of depths on the bathymetry raster (<code>bathy</code>) that the individual could plausibly have occupied at any time. Since the depth errors are added to the individual's depth, the first number should be negative (i.e., the individual could have been shallower that observed) and the second positive (i.e., the individual could have been deeper than observed). The appropriate form for <code>calc_depth_error</code> depends on the species (pelagic versus demersal/benthic species), the measurement error for the depth observations in <code>archival</code> and bathymetry (<code>bathy</code>) data, as well as the tidal range (m) across the area (over the duration of observations). For example, for a pelagic species, the constant function <code>calc_depth_error = function(...) matrix(c(-2.5, Inf)</code> implies that the individual could have occupied bathymetric cells that are deeper than the observed depth + (-2.5) m and shallower than Inf m (i.e. the individual could have been in any location in which the depth was deeper than the shallow depth limit for the individual). In contrast, for a benthic species, the constant function <code>calc_depth_error = function(...) matrix(c(-2.5, 2.5), nrow = 2)</code> implies that the individual could have occupied bathymetric cells whose depth lies within the interval defined by the observed depth + (-2.5) and + (+2.5) m.</p></dd>


<dt>normalise</dt>
<dd><p>A logical input that defines whether or not to normalise maps (see <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>).</p></dd>


<dt>save_record_spatial</dt>
<dd><p>An integer of the spatial layers to save (see <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>).</p></dd>


<dt>write_record_spatial_for_pf</dt>
<dd><p>A named list used to write time step-specific maps to file (see <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>).</p></dd>


<dt>save_args</dt>
<dd><p>A logical input that defines whether or not to save the list of function inputs (see <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>).</p></dd>


<dt>verbose</dt>
<dd><p>A logical variable that defines whether or not to print messages to the console or to file to relay function progress (see <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>).</p></dd>


<dt>con</dt>
<dd><p>If <code>verbose = TRUE</code>, <code>con</code> is character string defines how messages relaying function progress are returned (see <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>).</p></dd>


<dt>progress</dt>
<dd><p>An integer controlling the progress bar (see <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>).</p></dd>


<dt>split</dt>
<dd><p>A character string that defines the time unit used to split acoustic time series into chunks (see <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>).</p></dd>


<dt>cl, varlist</dt>
<dd><p>(optional) Parallelisation options (see <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>).</p></dd>

    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>The acoustic-container depth-contour (ACDC) algorithm is an approach which integrates acoustic detections and depth observations to infer the possible locations of tagged animals within an area over some time interval. The locational information provided by acoustic detections is represented by acoustic containers, which are areas around receivers that define where an individual could have been at each time point given the spatiotemporal pattern of detections at receivers, a model of detection probability and a movement parameter (see <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>). The locational information provided by depth observations is represented by depth contours, which are areas that define where an individual could have been at each time point given its depth and the local bathymetry (see <code><a href="dc.html">dc</a></code>).</p>
<p>In outline, the crux of the approach is the recognition that acoustic detections typically occur irregularly, while archival observations occur at regular intervals. Each detection anchors our knowledge of the location of an individual around a particular receiver (assuming that all detections are true detections). As time passes between acoustic detections, our uncertainty about the geographical location of an individual expands around the receiver at which it was detected before shrinking towards the receiver at which it was next detected. (This is the AC algorithm.) During this time, regular depth observations restrict the number of possible locations in which the individual could have been located at each time step, assuming that the bathymetric landscape is non-homogeneous. This is true both for pelagic species, which must be in an area where the depth of the seabed is at least as deep as the observed depth, and for benthic/demersal species, which must be in an area where the depth of the seabed is relatively close to the observed depth. (This is the DC algorithm.) In reality, the timing of acoustic and archival observations may not align perfectly; this is currently resolved by rounding the acoustic time series to the temporal resolution of depth observations (see also <code><a href="ac.html">ac</a></code>). In this way, the ACDC algorithm moves over acoustic and archival time steps, summing the positions in which individuals could have been located based on these two sources of data, to generate a map of that shows expected time spent in different parts of the study area over the time interval under consideration.</p>
