</h3>
<p>There is no theoretical obstacle to the incorporation of
receiver-specific detection ranges or detection probability models that
vary by receiver (or other environmental variables). In flapper,
receiver-specific detection containers are passed as objects to the
relevant algorithm function (i.e., <code><a href="../reference/ac.html">ac()</a></code>,
<code><a href="../reference/acdc.html">acdc()</a></code>). At the time of writing, the helper function used
to create detection containers (<code><a href="../reference/acs_setup_containers.html">acs_setup_containers()</a></code>)
assumes the detection range is constant across receivers, but custom
detection containers could be created and passed to the algorithm
similarly. The same goes for detection probability kernels. Since these
objects are created in advance, custom inputs are efficiently
incorporated. However, for larger and/or more complex
containers/kernels, calculations may take longer.</p>

different receivers handled?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-are-simultaneous-detections-of-the-same-transmission-on-different-receivers-handled"></a>
</h3>
<p>Assuming that the clocks of receivers are aligned, a simultaneous
detection of an individual at multiple receivers implies that the
individual must have been located within the intersection of those
receivers’ detection containers (at that moment in time), accounting for
the set of possible previous and future locations. Within this region,
the probability that the individual was in any given location depends on
the detection probability model.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="how-much-time-must-pass-without-detection-before-a-tag-could-be-anywhere-in-the-study-area">How much time must pass without detection before a tag could be
anywhere in the study area?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-much-time-must-pass-without-detection-before-a-tag-could-be-anywhere-in-the-study-area"></a>
</h3>
<p>This depends on the algorithm, the size and shape of study area, the
arrangement of receivers, the detection range and the movement capacity
of the tagged animal. These factors affect both how quickly an animal
can move away from an area and where it can go (i.e., the definition of
‘anywhere’). Take a circular study area of radius 1000 m with a single
receiver at the centre where an individual is both located and detected.
If we take a maximum swimming speed of 1 ms-1 and assume this can be
maintained indefinitely then, by time <span class="math inline">\((s)=distance (m)/speed (ms^{-1})\)</span>, the
individual could be located anywhere in the area after a detection gap
of 1000 s (about 17 minutes). This calculation provides an indication of
the duration between detections beyond which the set of possible
locations for the individual (and our uncertainty in its location) is
greatest and is effectively encapsulated by the AC/ACDC algorithm
(assuming a ‘negligibly small’ detection container). Allowing for
locational uncertainty within a detection container, then the time by
which the individual could reach the boundaries of the study area could
be smaller (because the starting position could be further away from the
receiver), though the area in which the individual could be located
following the detection is also reduced by the detection container (and
the shape of the detection probability kernel within that region). If
you refine the AC-branch outputs using the ACPF or ACDCPF algorithm, the
set of possible locations of the individual may expand less rapidly in
the gaps between detections, depending on the probability of different
rates of movement (as defined by the movement model), the presence of
additional constraints (such as the locations of receivers that did not
record detections, the depth at each time step or movement barriers) and
the stochastic sampling process. At the time of writing, we recommend
researchers consider the duration of detection gaps in relation to these
criteria and avoid implementing the algorithms over ‘long’ detection
gaps when information on the location of an individual is limited.
Ultimately, however, the definition of ‘long’ depends not only on the
aforementioned criteria but also a study’s objectives. For example, in
this study, we deliberately implement the algorithms over the complete
detection time series for a one-month period for an example individual
to test the hypothesis that the individual could have remained in the
study area (a Marine Protected Area) over this time interval. For
post-hoc evaluation of the influence of each time step on algorithm
outputs, you can examine the shape of the probability distribution of
the set of possible locations in which the individual could have been
located through time.</p>

<h3 id="the-different-flapper-algorithms-suggest-different-patterns-of-space-use--how-do-i-choose-which-algorithm-to-use">The different flapper algorithms suggest different patterns of space
use. How do I choose which algorithm to use?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-different-flapper-algorithms-suggest-different-patterns-of-space-use--how-do-i-choose-which-algorithm-to-use"></a>
</h3>
<p>The choice of algorithm depends on data availability and study
objectives. For reconstructing patterns of space use, the different
algorithms suggest different patterns because they incorporate different
information. Let’s use Fig. 3 in Lavender <em>et al.</em> (in review) to
illustrate this point and clarify algorithm choice. Recall that Fig. 3A
shows a map reconstructed from the depth time series; Fig. 3B–C show
maps reconstructed from acoustic detections; and Fig. 3D shows a map
based on both datasets. If you only have depth time series, or you are
interested in the extent to which a region (such as a Marine Protected
Area) represents the depths used by an individual, the DC algorithm
(Fig. 3A), is the appropriate choice. If you only have detection data at
receivers, you have the choice of a number of existing methods, such as
the mean-position algorithm (Fig. 3B), or our ACPF algorithm (Fig. 3C).
As noted in Lavender <em>et al.</em>, (in review), the relative utility
of these methods may vary in different settings but in clustered
receiver arrays the mean-position algorithm may perform poorly (Fig. 3B)
and the ACPF algorithm (Fig. 3C) is the clear choice here. If you have
both depth and detection time series, the ACDCPF algorithm is a
refinement. Thus, for flapper skate, the ACDCPF algorithm is the best
choice when it comes to reconstructing patterns of space use and Fig. 3D
is the most-refined map of space use for the analysed individual. In
summary, the best algorithm for reconstructing patterns of space use
depends on the data you have available: if you only have depth time
series, use the DC algorithm; if you only have acoustic time series, use
the ACPF algorithm; if you have both depth and acoustic data, then use
the ACDCPF algorithm, which can integrate both types of data.</p>

simply straight lines or least-cost paths?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-do-the-movement-paths-look-like-between-receivers-are-they-simply-straight-lines-or-least-cost-paths"></a>
</h3>
<p>Recall that in the PF-branch algorithm, a large number of particles
are sampled at each time step. Consequently, if the gaps between
detections span a large number of time steps, a large number of possible
paths may be reconstructed between receivers that are consistent with
the data (based on the connections between sequentially sampled
particles). This is one of the key innovations of our method because it
provides ‘a fuller exploration of possible movements than permitted
under the assumption that individuals follow least-cost paths between
detection containers’. The set of possible paths depends on the
information that is available to constrain the location of the animal in
the gaps between detections (i.e., the detection probability model and
receiver positions, the movement model and additional constraints, such
as depth observations and coastline). If there are few constraints on
individual locations and the gaps between detections span multiple time
steps, then different paths will ‘wander’ across the landscape,
generating a relatively smooth surface that reflects our uncertainty in
the possible location of the individual through time. If there are more
constraints, the set of possible paths may be more tightly focussed and
highlight several more-or-less likely ‘routes’ between receivers. Direct
linear or least-cost transitions between detection containers are only
likely to emerge if the time between detections is short (relative to
the movement capacity), such that the individual could (or must have)
moved directly from one to another during the detection gap.</p>

</h3>
<p>The mobility parameter controls how far an individual can move in any
given time step. Intuitively, underestimation of mobility will lead to
overly concentrated patterns of space use, while overestimation of
mobility will lead to overly diffuse patterns of space use. However,
these two outcomes are not necessarily equally plausible. Algorithm
sensitivity also depends on additional constraints, such as array
design.</p>
<p>First, note that it can be quite hard to underestimate the mobility
parameter. If you, for example, half mobility, the PF algorithm is
unlikely to converge: during the simulation of individual movements, you
are likely to reach a time step in which the set of locations in which
the individual could be located at a subsequent time step (given
previously sampled locations) does not overlap with the set of locations
within which the individual must have been located (given the data),
because mobility is too restricted (assuming you sample a sufficient
number of particles). This situation is more likely to arise in studies
in which constraints on an individual’s location through time (e.g.,
detections or ancillary time series) successfully restrict the number of
possible routes between sequential locations. If you attempt to repeat
the case-study analyses in Lavender <em>et al.</em> (in review) (e.g.,
analysis A2) with a reduced mobility, you will run into exactly this
issue. This provides good evidence that the mobility parameter is
appropriate for the analysed data in this study.</p>
<p>While it can be difficult to underestimate mobility, it is possible
to overestimate it. The effects of doing so will be most apparent in the
AC-branch algorithms and depend on constraints (such as array design).
In a sparse array that records few detections, there is little
information to constrain movement and an overestimated mobility
parameter will produce more diffuse patterns of space use. However, the
coupling of AC- and PF- branch algorithms can limit the influence of an
overestimated mobility parameter because the latter incorporates a
movement model in which longer-range movements, while permitted, can be
made less likely. This is what the movement model for flapper skate does
in Lavender <em>et al.</em> (in review).</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that these considerations are not
unique to our methods. The flapper algorithms simply make the influence
of movement constraints explicit, but the interpretation of passive
acoustic telemetry data in general (and particularly of patterns such as
residency) depends on knowledge of movement constraints. This has point
been emphasised by recent publications (Lavender <em>et al.</em>,
2021).</p>
<p>For practitioners seeking to apply our methods in new settings, we
make the following recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Study design phase</strong>. If you are designing a study,
plan to collect some information on individual movement speeds if
possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>Data analysis phase</strong>. If you already have
information on movement speeds, use it to inform the definition of the
movement constraints. Otherwise, examine the literature and use the
<code>get_mvt_mobility_*()</code> functions as a guide.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sensitivity analysis phase</strong>. If movement constraints
are uncertain, use simulation to explore the consequences of different
choices for mobility and the movement model within reasonable bounds for
your study system. While time consuming, you can also explore
implementations of the algorithms using lower-bound estimates of
mobility to test whether or not the algorithms fail to converge.
Increase the movement capacity until convergence.</li>

robust?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#under-what-set-of-tagreceiversite-conditions-are-the-algorithms-robust"></a>
</h3>
<p>The algorithms are always ‘robust’ in the sense that the
reconstructed set of possible locations of an individual is a complete,
mechanistic description of all inputted information about the location
of the animal through time (i.e., all detections, all gaps between
detections and all ancillary data, given the detection probability
model, the movement model and other parameters). Consequently, unless
the algorithm is misspecified (see below), the set of possible locations
will include the ‘true’ movement path, even in sparse arrays with few
detections. However, care is required in the interpretation of the ‘set
of possible locations of an individual through time’: while this, by
definition, will include the ‘true’ movement path, it is not guaranteed
(nor even desirable) that the pattern of space use exhibited by the set
of possible locations should match the pattern of space use exhibited by
the ‘true’ path.</p>
<p>While a correctly specified algorithm will reconstruct a set of
possible locations that includes the ‘true’ path (assuming you sample a
sufficiently large number of particles in the PF step), the algorithms
are sensitive to misspecification like any other method. However, the
consequences of mis specifying algorithm components, such as the
detection range, detection kernels or movement parameters, vary. See
‘Sensitivity’ for further commentary.</p>
<p>The ‘usefulness’ of the algorithms in different settings is a
separate issue. If tags malfunction, receivers are sparse and or
detection probability is limited, the flapper algorithms, like other
methods, are of limited utility: the set of possible locations will
simply span the ‘permitted’ area (mainly beyond receiver detection
containers) with more-or-less uniform probability. The quality of the
inputs unavoidably influences the utility of the outputs.</p>
<p>These comments notwithstanding, as for other emerging movement
modelling approaches in passive acoustic telemetry systems, more needs
to be learnt about the utility of the flapper algorithms in different
settings. As argued in the main text, an improved understanding of the
relative utility of different methods in different settings will help to
move the field forwards.</p>

</h3>
<p>The resolution of available data affects the temporal resolution of
the analysis. The transmission interval of acoustic tags sets a sensible
lower bound for this. In theory, a more frequent transmission interval
makes it possible to resolve movement paths at a higher temporal
resolution. However, in practice, the appropriate resolution of an
analysis will depend upon whether or not more frequent transmissions are
accompanied by more frequent detections, the resolution of other
datasets (such as depth time series), analytical objectives and
computational constraints. As for other methods, the optimisation of
study design and algorithm parameters for improved inference is an
avenue in which future research will be beneficial.</p>

</h3>
<p>Recall that the flapper algorithms are designed to recapitulate the
movement and detection processes that give rise to detections. This
means that, by definition, reconstructed patterns of space use will
contain the ‘true’ movement path (assuming they have been correctly
specified: see ‘Sensitivity’). As in Lavender <em>et al.</em> (in
review), you can explore the correspondence between a ‘known’ and
reconstructed movements under different conditions using simulation. In
real-world settings, fine-scale positioning records collected during
drift tests of detection probability can also be used for this purpose.
The probability distribution of the set of possible locations through
time provides a measure of our certainty in the location of an
individual: a flat surface emerges when there are few constraints on an
individual’s possible location and reflects low certainty; a more
concentrated surface emerges when the set of possible locations for an
individual is more constrained and reflects higher certainty. However,
even for more concentrated distributions, it is not guaranteed (nor even
desirable) that the pattern of space use exhibited by the simulated
locations will match the pattern of space use exhibited by the ‘true’
path (see ‘Optimisation’).</p>
