</h3>
<p>There is no theoretical obstacle to the incorporation of
receiver-specific detection ranges or detection probability models that
vary by receiver (or other environmental variables). In flapper,
receiver-specific detection containers are passed as objects to the
relevant algorithm function (i.e., <code><a href="../reference/ac.html">ac()</a></code>,
<code><a href="../reference/acdc.html">acdc()</a></code>). At the time of writing, the helper function used
to create detection containers (<code><a href="../reference/acs_setup_containers.html">acs_setup_containers()</a></code>)
assumes the detection range is constant across receivers, but custom
detection containers could be created and passed to the algorithm
similarly. The same goes for detection probability kernels. Since these
objects are created in advance, custom inputs are efficiently
incorporated. However, for larger and/or more complex
containers/kernels, calculations may take longer.</p>

</h3>
<p>Assuming that the clocks of receivers are aligned, a simultaneous
detection of an individual at multiple receivers implies that the
individual must have been located within the intersection of those
receivers’ detection containers (at that moment in time), accounting for
the set of possible previous and future locations. Within this region,
the probability that the individual was in any given location depends on
the detection probability model.</p>

</h3>
<p>This depends on the algorithm, the size and shape of study area, the
arrangement of receivers, the detection range and the movement capacity
of the tagged animal. These factors affect both how quickly an animal
can move away from an area and where it can go (i.e., the definition of
‘anywhere’). Take a circular study area of radius 1000 m with a single
receiver at the centre where an individual is both located and detected.
If we take a maximum swimming speed of 1 ms-1 and assume this can be
maintained indefinitely then, by time <span class="math inline">\((s)=distance (m)/speed (ms^{-1})\)</span>, the
individual could be located anywhere in the area after a detection gap
of 1000 s (about 17 minutes). This calculation provides an indication of
the duration between detections beyond which the set of possible
locations for the individual (and our uncertainty in its location) is
greatest and is effectively encapsulated by the AC/ACDC algorithm
(assuming a ‘negligibly small’ detection container). Allowing for
locational uncertainty within a detection container, then the time by
which the individual could reach the boundaries of the study area could
be smaller (because the starting position could be further away from the
receiver), though the area in which the individual could be located
following the detection is also reduced by the detection container (and
the shape of the detection probability kernel within that region). If
you refine the AC-branch outputs using the ACPF or ACDCPF algorithm, the
set of possible locations of the individual may expand less rapidly in
the gaps between detections, depending on the probability of different
rates of movement (as defined by the movement model), the presence of
additional constraints (such as the locations of receivers that did not
record detections, the depth at each time step or movement barriers) and
the stochastic sampling process. At the time of writing, we recommend
researchers consider the duration of detection gaps in relation to these
criteria and avoid implementing the algorithms over ‘long’ detection
gaps when information on the location of an individual is limited.
Ultimately, however, the definition of ‘long’ depends not only on the
aforementioned criteria but also a study’s objectives. For example, in
this study, we deliberately implement the algorithms over the complete
detection time series for a one-month period for an example individual
to test the hypothesis that the individual could have remained in the
study area (a Marine Protected Area) over this time interval. For
post-hoc evaluation of the influence of each time step on algorithm
outputs, you can examine the shape of the probability distribution of
the set of possible locations in which the individual could have been
located through time.</p>

</h3>
<p>The flapper algorithms simply resolve the set of locations in which a
tag could have been located through time, given the data and supporting
information (e.g., detection probability). They make no judgement about
whether a tagged individual has died or expelled the transmitter. If you
have a stationary tag regularly transmitting within the detection
container of a receiver, then the set of possible locations for the tag
is restricted by this information and this is what is recapitulated by
the flapper algorithms. Overlapping receivers and/or ancillary
observations place additional restrictions on the possible locations of
a tag which can make it possible to determine location more precisely.
However, if there are gaps in detections due to imperfect detection
probability, then the flapper algorithms may also (correctly) permit
limited movements beyond the receiver’s detection container (unless you
have defined a movement model in which the probability of ‘movement’ is
lower under certain conditions, for instance for individuals that were
tagged in poor condition or after a certain period of time due to an
increase in tag expulsion or mortality risk).</p>
<p>We reiterate: the algorithms simply provide an honest assessment of
the set of possible locations that are consistent with the data through
time. With any individual time series, this is the complete extent of
our knowledge, and that is the point of the flapper algorithms. If you,
as a researcher, have external information about the likelihood of tag
expulsion or death from study of the detection patterns of multiple
individuals, in which serially repeated detections are unusual, then you
are at liberty to infer expulsion or mortality. In unclear cases with
detection gaps, reconstructing the set of possible locations through
time may help to suggest whether tag expulsion/mortality is a more
likely explanation of the data (given the scale of possible movements
away from receivers) than other possibilities, although some
back-of-the-envelope calculations may be simpler. If you are confident
about tag expulsion or mortality, we would generally recommend against
implementing the flapper algorithms, although there are circumstances in
which this could be useful (for example, identification of the possible
location(s) of a stationary tag facilitates opportunistic study of
detection probability).</p>

seasonal changes, reproduction or ontogeny?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-can-i-handle-dramatic-changes-in-behaviour-associated-with-seasonal-changes-reproduction-or-ontogeny"></a>
</h3>
<p>Passive acoustic telemetry has opened the door to studies of
individuals over extended time scales that may encompass seasonal,
reproductive and ontogenetic changes in movement. In theory, these
changes can be handled in the flapper algorithms through the
incorporation of a time-varying movement model. However, behavioural
switches need to be specified as part of the algorithm implementation:
the flapper algorithms do not estimate movement parameters; they simply
use the data to reconstruct the set of locations through time that is
consistent with known properties of movement (and other algorithm
components). That being said, in practice, we recommend structuring
analyses on the basis of existing knowledge of animal movement and life
history. If there are notable seasonal changes in movement, for
instance, the simple approach is to implement separate, season-specific
algorithms. Under specific conditions, no information is lost with this
approach with existing routines. More generally, any information lost
(from the end of one time series to the start of another) is negligible.
Over longer, multi-annual time series, implementations of the flapper
algorithms, as illustrated here, are likely to be prohibitively
expensive in computational terms. Further work is needed to develop
tailored methodologies that can handle these volumes of data. This
includes computational optimisation of existing routines and
consideration of the influence of algorithm resolution and data
processing (e.g., thinning detections, as suggested by Aspillaga et
al. [2019a]) on reconstructed patterns.</p>

</h3>
<p>This is an important, and very general, query about how to reconcile
datasets (such as animal tracks and environmental data products) that
differ in resolution and uncertainty. There is a limited amount of
specific advice we can offer in this context, but there are some
important points that need to be made, starting with the resolution at
which movements can be resolved. In this study, we develop the
algorithms in discretised form, with locations represented on a uniform
grid. The consequence of this approach is that grid resolution
determines the resolution of the outputs and uncertainty (as measured by
the number of locations on the grid in which an individual could have
been located and their associated probabilities) is propagated
accordingly. A large number of possible locations (with similar
probabilities) reflects a high degree of uncertainty and a smaller
number of locations (and/or a skewed probability distribution) reflects
a lower degree of uncertainty. The degree of uncertainty at any one time
depends on the strength of the constraints on individual location,
including observations, array design, movement capacity and other
parameters. This means that the spatial scale of uncertainty can be much
smaller than the detection container of a receiver, or rather larger. In
the ACPF algorithm, for instance, the growth, expansion and intersection
of acoustic containers depends on array design, detection range,
movement capacity and the detection time series. In the ACDCPF
algorithm, the incorporation of depth time series can dramatically
reduce uncertainty, as shown in this study. Both flapper algorithms are
unique in that all of these properties of the system mechanistically
determine uncertainty. Moreover, (almost) no further reductions in
uncertainty can be achieved without the imposition of additional
constraints (such as new data): the dynamics of the system are
comprehensively represented. Incidentally, in all other methods,
uncertainty is necessarily higher because only a subset of the full
suite of constraints on individual location is incorporated. This point
is not obvious because uncertainty is typically unquantified or only
quantified indirectly by other methods, so the true level of uncertainty
in an individual’s location is unknown.</p>
<p>What are the implications of high uncertainty for analyses of habitat
use? It is true that when uncertainty is high and substrates are
spatially heterogeneous, we can be less certain about the habitat use of
an individual and the flapper algorithms will reflect this uncertainty.
But here we are limited by the data and not the methodology. In fact,
from a methodological perspective, the propagation of uncertainty is
highly desirable because it safeguards against overconfident or
misplaced inferences. As we show for the mean-position algorithm,
failure to consider movements away from receivers can suggest highly
biased patterns of habitat use (Fig. 3).</p>
<p>So how can we reconcile the resolution and uncertainty of the flapper
algorithms with habitat data that differ in resolution and uncertainty?
As noted above, this is a difficult question that pervades the fields of
movement ecology and spatial modelling. In previous work investigating
possible habitat preferences in flapper skate, we studied the
distribution of environmental conditions within detection containers
(Lavender et al., 2021). The flapper algorithms resolve movement both
within and beyond detection containers, facilitating more holistic
analyses of habitat preferences. In general, our approach is to use
habitat data at the resolution and extent at which it is available.
Where habitat data provide an important constraint on individual
location and are used as part of a flapper algorithm, we suggest
implementing the flapper algorithms at a similar resolution (where
practical). For example, in this study, we incorporated a bathymetry
layer at the original (5 x 5 m) resolution and resolved movements across
the same grid. This approach trades off computation time with precision.
In our study system, depth time series impose a strong constraint on
location. This constraint dramatically weakens if you aggregate the
data, which greatly reduces the utility of depth observations for
reconstructing movements. We recommend practitioners consult the
documentation of the process_surface() function for advice in this
context.</p>
<p>Where the outputs of the flapper algorithms are combined with
environmental data to infer habitat use, we also broadly favour using
data at their original resolution. It is not clear what could be gained
by aggregating (or disaggregating) data. As explained above, the
precision with which movements are resolved by the flapper algorithm can
change through time but uncertainty is propagated. Moreover,
environmental datasets are often complex data products that incorporate
observations, interpolation and modelling. Aggregation of these datasets
can mask important variation and add another layer of complexity when it
comes to understanding uncertainty that is usually swept under the rug.
That being said, where aggregation (or disaggregation) is necessary, we
encourage the use of simulations and comparisons (where feasible) to
evaluate the influence of resolution on results.</p>

</h3>
<p>Recall that in the PF-branch algorithm, a large number of particles
are sampled at each time step. Consequently, if the gaps between
detections span a large number of time steps, a large number of possible
paths may be reconstructed between receivers that are consistent with
the data (based on the connections between sequentially sampled
particles). This is one of the key innovations of our method because it
provides ‘a fuller exploration of possible movements than permitted
under the assumption that individuals follow least-cost paths between
detection containers’. The set of possible paths depends on the
information that is available to constrain the location of the animal in
the gaps between detections (i.e., the detection probability model and
receiver positions, the movement model and additional constraints, such
as depth observations and coastline). If there are few constraints on
individual locations and the gaps between detections span multiple time
steps, then different paths will ‘wander’ across the landscape,
generating a relatively smooth surface that reflects our uncertainty in
the possible location of the individual through time. If there are more
constraints, the set of possible paths may be more tightly focussed and
highlight several more-or-less likely ‘routes’ between receivers. Direct
linear or least-cost transitions between detection containers are only
likely to emerge if the time between detections is short (relative to
the movement capacity), such that the individual could (or must have)
moved directly from one to another during the detection gap.</p>

</h3>
<p>The short answer to this is ‘no’. To see why, first consider passive
acoustic telemetry in isolation. In an acoustic array, the information
we have on an individual’s location is limited to detections at
receivers, detection probability and movement capacity (in the context
of barriers to movement, such as coastline). Of these sources of
information, most approaches for modelling acoustic time series
(including the mean-position algorithm) only consider detections at
receivers, which means there is typically a high degree of uncertainty
in the individual’s location through time (even if this is not
represented). By considering the detection and movement processes that
generate observations, the ACPF algorithm more effectively represents
uncertainty, but it still exists. However, if we consider additional
sources of information on individual location (which is possible within
the flapper algorithms), our uncertainty can decrease. (This is
naturally quantified by a reduction in the number of locations in which
the individual could have been located, accounting for their relative
probabilities.) Imagine we collect both acoustic and archival (depth)
time series. Now, when an individual is detected, we know not only that
it must be within the detection container of a receiver but we can
identify the subset of locations that is also consistent with the
observed depth. The same principle is true in the gaps between
detections. These additional restrictions can lead to differences in
maps of space use. It is not that a map constructed with acoustic time
series alone is ‘wrong’ whilst one constructed with both acoustic and
archival time series is ‘right’. With the flapper algorithms, both maps
are valid representations of the individual’s possible locations, given
the data, it’s just that depth observations place an additional
restriction on location that refines the map. More generally, datasets
that place multiple, distinct restrictions on location suggest more
refined maps of space use. These differences are not only inevitable but
desirable.</p>
<p>Quantification of the extent to which the addition of new datasets
updates maps of space use is valuable because it indicates the relative
amount of information contained within different datasets, which can
guide tag and array deployment programmes. In our illustrative analyses
of flapper skate, it is clear that the integration of both acoustic and
archival data refines reconstructed patterns of space use (Fig. 3). This
demonstrates the benefits of a coupled acoustic and archival tagging
programme in our study area. Building on this work, where feasible, we
encourage practitioners leading tag and array deployment programmes to
evaluate the merits of designing systems that collect detections
alongside ancillary data (such as depth observations). Obvious
considerations concern the accuracy of ancillary data and the resolution
of background (e.g., depth) layers. In general, if background data
layers are relatively homogeneous, then collecting ancillary information
is unlikely to refine maps of space use substantially and improvements
to the receiver network may be a better use of limited resources (except
perhaps in situations where background data resolution, while currently
a limiting factor, is expected to improve). In contrast, if background
data layers are heterogeneous, then coupling passive acoustic telemetry
with ancillary information on individual habitat use has the potential
to refine inferences and investments in ancillary recording capacities
may be worthwhile. We support the use of simulation to explore the
relative value of different datasets (though comparison of maps
reconstructed from different combinations of information) and note the
potential to integrate this research with economic modelling to design
optimal array/tag deployment programmes that maximise the information
gleaned for a given budget.</p>
<p>Where beneficial, we also encourage practitioners to exploit the
flexibility of the flapper algorithms to incorporate multiple datasets
by considering not only acoustic and archival time series, but other
spatially or temporally heterogeneous data types as well (such as
salinity or temperature). The construction of the algorithms provides a
straightforward means to ‘slot in’ ancillary data in the same way that
we incorporate depth time series. All you need is a model that compares
ancillary observations and a background layer to describe the
probability of an individual being in any given location through time,
according to that particular dataset. This information can be combined
with equivalent surfaces from the AC algorithm (via eqn 13 in Lavender
et al. 2023) and PF can be implemented for the combined surfaces in the
usual way. When you do this, do not feel disconcerted if the results
change: it is a sign that your efforts have been worthwhile.</p>

</h3>
<p>The choice of algorithm depends on data availability and study
objectives. For reconstructing patterns of space use, the different
algorithms suggest different patterns because they incorporate different
information. Let’s use Fig. 3 in Lavender <em>et al.</em> (2023) to
illustrate this point and clarify algorithm choice. Recall that Fig. 3A
shows a map reconstructed from the depth time series; Fig. 3B–C show
maps reconstructed from acoustic detections; and Fig. 3D shows a map
based on both datasets. If you only have depth time series, or you are
interested in the extent to which a region (such as a Marine Protected
Area) represents the depths used by an individual, the DC algorithm
(Fig. 3A), is the appropriate choice. If you only have detection data at
receivers, you have the choice of a number of existing methods, such as
the mean-position algorithm (Fig. 3B), or our ACPF algorithm (Fig. 3C).
As noted in Lavender <em>et al.</em> (2023), the relative utility of
these methods may vary in different settings but in clustered receiver
arrays the mean-position algorithm may perform poorly (Fig. 3B) and the
ACPF algorithm (Fig. 3C) is the clear choice here. If you have both
depth and detection time series, the ACDCPF algorithm is a refinement.
Thus, for flapper skate, the ACDCPF algorithm is the best choice when it
comes to reconstructing patterns of space use and Fig. 3D is the
most-refined map of space use for the analysed individual. In summary,
the best algorithm for reconstructing patterns of space use depends on
the data you have available: if you only have depth time series, use the
DC algorithm; if you only have acoustic time series, use the ACPF
algorithm; if you have both depth and acoustic data, then use the ACDCPF
algorithm, which can integrate both types of data.</p>

</h3>
<p>We have emphasised above that different algorithms can produce
different patterns of space use (and we should not be disconcerted by
this). The purpose of Fig. 3E is to take this point one step further and
illustrate that differences in patterns of space use reconstructed by
different methods have wider implications, using the example of sediment
use. What Fig. 3E is showing is the proportion of each sediment type
that is found within the core range suggested by each algorithm, as
delineated in Figs 3B–D, relative to the proportional availability of
each sediment type in the study area at large. According to the
mean-position algorithm, the proportion of muddy sand in the
individual’s core area substantially exceeds background levels. But the
mean-position algorithm is strongly biased by the locations of receivers
and this result is thus an artefact of COA’s localised distribution. By
accounting for possible movement away from receivers, the flapper
algorithms produce more informative maps of space use, as explained
previously, and these suggest a different conclusion. According to both
flapper algorithms, the use of muddy sand is not considerably higher
than we might expect (given the prevalence of this sediment type in the
study area) and the results instead point ‘towards the exploitation of
multiple benthic habitats, in concordance with recent work’ (Thorburn et
al., 2021). That being said, the most refined map of space use (Fig.
3D), which integrates information from both acoustic and archival time
series, suggests that mud is used proportionally more than the other
sediment types, relative to background availability. We should be
cautious of overinterpreting this result for a single individual, but it
highlights a potential habitat preference that is worthy of further
study.</p>

</h3>
<p>Simulations are a device we can use to explore algorithm behaviour
and utility in different settings, but care is needed in the
interpretation of such analyses. In the flapper algorithms, unlike other
methods, it is necessarily true that maps reconstructed by (correctly
specified) algorithm implementations will encompass the true path (given
sufficient samples). In general terms, it is also true that we should
expect a ‘reasonable’ match between simulated and reconstructed
patterns, and that this match should often be better than for methods
that do not encapsulate the processes that generate observations.
However, what is ‘reasonable’ depends on the information provided by
observations (and other algorithm components). In systems with ‘high’
information, there are strong restrictions on the possible locations of
an individual though time and we expect a close match between simulated
and reconstructed patterns. In contrast, in systems with low information
(the typical case), there are fewer such restrictions and a wider range
of movements could have generated the observations. In this kind of
situation, movements beyond a simulated path allowed by the observations
can lead to differences between that path, which is only one realisation
of a particular data-generating process, and the reconstructed pattern,
which encapsulates the range of movements that could have generated the
observations. Thus, you should not be surprised if simulated and
reconstructed patterns do not match perfectly.</p>
<p>There are important consequences of the representation of uncertainty
in the flapper algorithms when it comes to comparing the fidelity with
which different algorithms reconstruct a simulated path. As we show in
this study, in any individual case, COAs from the mean-position
algorithm may align more closely with the true path than particle
samples from the flapper algorithms (for instance, because the latter
permit movement into areas where the individual could have, but did not,
venture). Since particle samples represent the distribution of
possibilities, it is only on average (if one imagines many simulated
outcomes of a data-generating process) that we expect (correctly
specified) flapper algorithms to reconstruct the true path more
accurately (especially in non-uniform arrays) than methods that do not
recapitulate the data-generating process. That being said, we cannot at
this stage discount the possibility that the mean-position algorithm (or
other methods) may outperform the flapper algorithms in unexpected
settings. We encourage the use of simulations to compare the behaviour
of different approaches in different scenarios to guide analyses. A key
avenue for future research is to develop quantitative metrics for the
comparisons of simulated and modelled patterns of space use in different
settings.</p>
<p>Alongside the fidelity with which the true path is reconstructed in
any particular situation, the wider advantages and disadvantages of each
method should be used to guide the choice of methodology. Important
criteria include implementation ease, speed and study objectives. For
example, by accounting for movement in the gaps between detections, the
flapper algorithms are well-suited to studies of residency, whereas
alternative methods (such as the mean-position algorithm, network
analysis and Aspillaga et al.’s (2019a) synthetic-path method) are
not.</p>

</h3>
<p>The mobility parameter controls how far an individual can move in any
given time step. Intuitively, under-estimation of mobility will lead to
overly concentrated patterns of space use, while over-estimation of
mobility will lead to overly diffuse patterns of space use. However,
these two outcomes are not necessarily equally plausible. Algorithm
sensitivity also depends on additional constraints, such as array
design.</p>
<p>First, note that it can be quite hard to under-estimate the mobility
parameter. If you, for example, halve mobility, the PF algorithm may
fail to converge: during the simulation of individual movements, you may
reach a time step in which the set of locations in which the individual
could be located at a subsequent time step (given previously sampled
locations) does not overlap with the set of locations within which the
individual must have been located (given the data), because mobility is
too restricted (assuming you sample a sufficient number of particles).
This situation is more likely to arise in studies in which constraints
on an individual’s location through time (e.g., detections or ancillary
time series) successfully restrict the number of possible routes between
sequential locations.</p>
<p>While it can be difficult to under-estimate mobility, it is possible
to over-estimate it. The effects of doing so will be most apparent in
the AC-branch algorithms and depend on constraints (such as array
design). In a sparse array that records few detections, there is little
information to constrain movement and an over-estimated mobility
parameter will produce more diffuse patterns of space use. However, the
coupling of AC- and PF- branch algorithms can limit the influence of an
over-estimated mobility parameter because the latter incorporates a
movement model in which longer-range movements, while permitted, can be
made less likely. This is what the movement model for flapper skate does
in Lavender <em>et al.</em> (2023).</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that these considerations are not
unique to our methods. The flapper algorithms simply make the influence
of movement constraints explicit, but the interpretation of passive
acoustic telemetry data in general (and particularly of patterns such as
residency) depends on knowledge of movement constraints. This has point
been emphasised by recent publications (Lavender <em>et al.</em>,
2021).</p>
<p>For practitioners seeking to apply our methods in new settings, we
make the following recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Study design phase</strong>. If you are designing a study,
plan to collect some information on individual movement speeds if
possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>Data analysis phase</strong>. If you already have
information on movement speeds, use it to inform the definition of the
movement constraints. Otherwise, examine the literature and use the
<code>get_mvt_mobility_*()</code> functions as a guide.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sensitivity analysis phase</strong>. If movement constraints
are uncertain, use simulation to explore the consequences of different
choices for mobility and the movement model within reasonable bounds for
your study system. While time consuming, you can also explore
implementations of the algorithms using lower-bound estimates of
mobility to test whether or not the algorithms fail to converge.
Increase the movement capacity until convergence.</li>

</h3>
<p>The algorithms are always ‘robust’ in the sense that the
reconstructed set of possible locations of an individual is a complete,
mechanistic description of all inputted information about the location
of the animal through time (i.e., all detections, all gaps between
detections and all ancillary data, given the detection probability
model, the movement model and other parameters). Consequently, unless
the algorithm is mis-specified (see below), the set of possible
locations will include the ‘true’ movement path, even in sparse arrays
with few detections. However, care is required in the interpretation of
the ‘set of possible locations of an individual through time’: while
this, by definition, will include the ‘true’ movement path, it is not
guaranteed (nor even desirable) that the pattern of space use exhibited
by the set of possible locations should match the pattern of space use
exhibited by the ‘true’ path.</p>
<p>While a correctly specified algorithm will reconstruct a set of
possible locations that includes the ‘true’ path (assuming you sample a
sufficiently large number of particles in the PF step), the algorithms
are sensitive to misspecification like any other method. However, the
consequences of mis-specifying algorithm components, such as the
detection range, detection kernels or movement parameters, vary. See
‘Sensitivity’ for further commentary.</p>
<p>The ‘usefulness’ of the algorithms in different settings is a
separate issue. If tags malfunction, receivers are sparse and or
detection probability is limited, the flapper algorithms, like other
methods, are of limited utility: the set of possible locations will
simply span the ‘permitted’ area (mainly beyond receiver detection
containers) with more-or-less uniform probability. The quality of the
inputs unavoidably influences the utility of the outputs.</p>
<p>These comments notwithstanding, as for other emerging movement
modelling approaches in passive acoustic telemetry systems, more needs
to be learnt about the utility of the flapper algorithms in different
settings. As argued in Lavender et al. (2023), an improved understanding
of the relative utility of different methods in different settings will
help to move the field forwards.</p>

<p>The resolution of available data affects the temporal resolution of
the analysis. The transmission interval of acoustic tags sets a sensible
lower bound for this. In theory, a more frequent transmission interval
makes it possible to resolve movement paths at a higher temporal
resolution. However, in practice, the appropriate resolution of an
analysis will depend upon whether or not more frequent transmissions are
accompanied by more frequent detections, the resolution of other
datasets (such as depth time series), analytical objectives and
computational constraints. As for other methods, the optimisation of
study design and algorithm parameters for improved inference is an
avenue in which future research will be beneficial.</p>

<p>Recall that the flapper algorithms are designed to recapitulate the
movement and detection processes that give rise to detections. This
means that, by definition, reconstructed patterns of space use will
contain the ‘true’ movement path (assuming they have been correctly
specified: see ‘Sensitivity’). As in Lavender <em>et al.</em> (2023),
you can explore the correspondence between a ‘known’ and reconstructed
movements under different conditions using simulation. In real-world
settings, fine-scale positioning records collected during drift tests of
detection probability can also be used for this purpose. The probability
distribution of the set of possible locations through time provides a
measure of our certainty in the location of an individual: a flat
surface emerges when there are few constraints on an individual’s
possible location and reflects low certainty; a more concentrated
surface emerges when the set of possible locations for an individual is
more constrained and reflects higher certainty. However, even for more
concentrated distributions, it is not guaranteed (nor even desirable)
that the pattern of space use exhibited by the simulated locations will
match the pattern of space use exhibited by the ‘true’ path (see
‘Optimisation’).</p>

</h3>
<p>The central contribution of the flapper framework is the mechanistic
perspective that recapitulates the processes that generate observations.
This perspective has a number of methodological benefits:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>Data integration. The flapper algorithms naturally integrate
multiple sources of information, including detections, the detection
process (for any array design), movement capacity, barriers to movement
and ancillary data. Previous studies have shown that the absence of
these processes (especially detection probability, which has received
most attention) can bias inferences (Pedersen &amp; Weng, 2013; Winton
et al., 2018). This finding is developed by this study.<br>
</li>
<li>Uncertainty. By recapitulating the processes that generate
observations, the flapper algorithms inherently propagate uncertainty.
This is naturally measured by the set of possible locations of an
individual at each time step (and their associated probabilities). Lower
uncertainty results in more concentrated patterns of space use, while
higher uncertainty manifests as more diffuse patterns of space use. This
contrasts with other methods that either do not represent uncertainty
(e.g., the mean-position algorithm) or in which uncertainty does not
emerge directly from the data-generating processes but is applied
post-hoc (e.g., refined-shortest paths [RSPs]).</li>
<li>Smoothing. The flapper algorithms naturally reconstruct utilisation
distributions without post-hoc smoothing. The latter can be useful, in
some circumstances, however. Simulations suggest that flapper algorithm
outputs (i.e., POU maps) may be less sensitive to the degree of
smoothing than the outputs from other algorithms—namely, COAs (see Fig.
S14).</li>
<li>Movements. Movement can be flexibly incorporated into the flapper
algorithms via a movement model. The representation of movements in the
gaps between detections is particularly significant.<br>
</li>
<li>Shortest paths. In the reconstruction of possible movements,
shortest paths are easily incorporated. This is a detail, but we mention
it because there is wide interest in shortest path calculations in the
ecological literature (van Etten, 2017; Wang, 2020). Within the flapper
package, we exploit shortest path routines and novel approximations that
are more efficient that those typically used in the ecological
literature (Aspillaga et al., 2019a, 2019b; Niella et al., 2020; Wang,
2020).</li>
</ol>
<p>These methodological innovations have important practical
consequences:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>Interpretation. Because the flapper algorithms are process-based,
the outputs have a natural interpretation. At each time step, we resolve
the set of locations within which the individual could have been located
(and their associated probabilities). Using these locations, we can
construct possible movement paths or (gridded) maps of space use in
which each cell represents POU or the probability that the individual
was in that location at a randomly chosen time. This natural
interpretation is generally lacking in other methods. For example, the
mean-position algorithm averages the locations of receivers at which
individuals are detected and, while these averages have been called
COAs, the extent to which receiver-location averages have a meaningful,
biological interpretation is questionable in many circumstances.</li>
<li>Movement paths. Within the flapper algorithms, the movement paths
that could have generated observations are reconstructed. This differs
from ‘top-down’ approaches such as the mean-position algorithm in which
movements are unresolved. It also differs from other ‘synthetic path’
approaches that generate least-cost path(s) between detection containers
(which are at least consistent with the locations of detection) in that
the representation of detection gaps permits a fuller exploration of the
distribution of possible movements. Furthermore, the integration of
ancillary data means that paths can (potentially) be resolved more
precisely than possible with discrete detection data alone (e.g., Fig.
3). This moves passive acoustic telemetry a (small) step closer to other
animal tracking technologies and facilitates analyses of fine-scale
movements and their drivers, alongside studies of receiver- and
array-scale movement metrics (such as time spent around receivers).</li>
<li>Space use. As shown in this study, the recapitulation of the
data-generating processes in the flapper algorithms and the integration
of multiple data types can generate more refined maps of space use. By
resolving the distribution of possible movements, maps can be less
biased by receiver locations and more useful for prediction. This
facilitates improved analyses of patterns of space use and their
drivers, such as habitat preferences.<br>
</li>
<li>Residency. The resolution of movements both during periods of
detection and in the gaps between detections makes the flapper
algorithms uniquely well-suited to analyses of residency. With the
flapper algorithms, it is possible to investigate residency in regions
with incomplete receiver coverage, such as MPAs. In our study area, we
demonstrate that data collected from an example flapper skate are
consistent with continued residency, despite gaps in detections during
which the individual could have moved beyond the study area. This is not
proof of residency, but it is the first conclusive demonstration that
residency is a valid explanation that is fully consistent with the data.
This is a step beyond the residency indices that have been developed in
previous studies, which have (necessarily) been based on time spent
around receivers, rather in wider regions of interest (Kessel et al.,
2016; Lavender et al., 2021).</li>
</ol>
<p>We encourage users to consider these potential advantages in the
context of those of other methods, alongside their respective
disadvantages, to evaluate the relative merits of existing approaches in
different settings.</p>

algorithms?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-future-research-avenues-are-suggested-by-the-flapper-algorithms"></a>
</h3>
<p>The flapper algorithms encapsulate a new, bottom-up, mechanistic
perspective of passive acoustic telemetry systems. This perspective has
notable conceptual and practical advantages that have the potential to
support applied research in the future (see above). However, our main
hope is that this unique perspective will motivate a conversation about
how we model passive acoustic telemetry data and encourage new research
into the dynamics, performance, sensitivity, optimisation and uses of
alternative methods in different settings, which are areas that have
hitherto received insufficient attention. In this context, we highlight
eight avenues for future methodological research that emerge from this
study:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>Dynamics. Questions remain over how we can model the processes that
generate observations most realistically (and usefully) in different
settings. For example, in the AC algorithm, the dynamics of acoustic
containers are a conceptually appealing representation of how the set of
possible locations for an individual evolves between two detections, but
we can envisage other possible ways of capturing the same information
that may have advantages. Scope also remains to represent hierarchical
dynamics that emerge in studies of multiple individuals, such as
transmission collisions.</li>
<li>Sensitivity. The sensitivity of all methods to data processing
decisions and different parameters in different settings requires
further study.</li>
<li>Optimisation. Key questions remain around how algorithm settings can
be tuned to improve inference in different contexts. For example, with
respect to the flapper algorithms, what is the optimal resolution at
which to resolve movements that maximises performance but minimises
computation time?</li>
<li>Approximation. For practical applications, understanding how we can
best approximate the processes that generate observations in different
settings and for different purposes is critical. With our holistic,
mechanistic framework as a baseline, we encourage modellers to frame
new, bottom-up methods explicitly in terms of how they approximate the
processes that generate observations. This should make it easier to
interpret algorithms, understand uncertainty and judge methods (on the
basis of whether or not selected approximations are acceptable).</li>
<li>Performance. Understanding how the performance of alternative
methods (including the mean-position algorithm, the flapper algorithms
and other approaches) for reconstructing patterns of space use varies in
different settings remains a key knowledge gap. We encourage the use of
simulation studies to explore algorithm performance in different
settings. This process will be supported by research into the behaviour
of quantitative metrics of performance.</li>
<li>Packages. The accessibility and speed of method implementations,
including those provided by the flapper, fishtrack3d (Aspillaga et al.,
2019a, 2019b) and RSP (Niella et al., 2020) packages, are key areas for
improvement. Highly optimised routines for both ‘approximate’ and
‘greedy’ algorithms are required to facilitate both methodological
research (e.g., comparisons of alternative methods) and practical
applications.</li>
<li>Applications. Much remains to be learnt about the relative utility
of existing methods in different settings and we encourage practitioners
to trial multiple approaches, including the flapper algorithms, in
different settings.<br>
</li>
<li>Array design. The flapper algorithms present opportunities to inform
tag and array deployment programmes. We encourage the use of simulations
to study the relative benefits of investments in different technologies
(such as acoustic receivers and archival tags) in different settings and
exploration of how the methods can be used to inform optimal array
designs.</li>
