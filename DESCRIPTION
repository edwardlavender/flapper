Title: Routines for the analysis of passive acoustic telemetry data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Edward Lavender
Maintainer: Edward Lavender <el72@st-andrews.ac.uk>
Description: Routines for the analysis of passive acoustic telemetry data, including for data processing, description (via detection statistics and movement metrics), modelling and simulation. These routines are supported by a series of helper functions (including distance calculators, spatial tools and parallelisation options). The main contribution is the provision of a family of algorithms for movement modelling in passive acoustic telemetry systems that permits the reconstruction of fine-scale movement paths and emergent patterns of space use. Package development has been motivated by passive acoustic telemetry data from a Critically Endangered benthic elasmobranch off the west coast of Scotland.
